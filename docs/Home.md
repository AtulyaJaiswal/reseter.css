### Mission

CSS Resets were declining, the maintaince was getting poor, css resets were on the verge of eradication! I was really a fan of css resets, they were a great idea. I personally used all of the css resets to find my match, none of them successed but the industry standard normalize.css took my attention. It wasn't soon the maintaince was getting poor, none updates were being published, the flavor was gone. At that time I was learning advanced css, I wanted more of the taste in a css reset, this was where reseter.css was born. It is been 2 years since the birth, but 3 months since the release. You might got to know that reseter.css must have been widely tested and improved over time! Yes it was and is improving over time! I want a css reset that can change people's thoughts upons css resets. I want a css reset that can sustain forever!
